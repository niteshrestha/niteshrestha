I'm a <b>Software Engineer</b> for [Braindigit](https://www.braindigit.com/) building intelligent services. I mostly build services in <code>.NET Core</code> along with some <code>python</code> magic. Me & Visual Studio are BBFs. To me <code>C#</code> isn't a language, it's a lifestyle.

- 🎧 Listening to: Whatevers playing in Spotify
